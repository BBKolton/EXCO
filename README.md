# Experimental College Website
This is the new website for the ASUW's Experimental College. The new dev site is available on http://depts.washington.edu/asuwecwb until it moves to http://EXCO.org upon release

### About EXCO
EXCO is an adult continuing education college, that strives to teach classes outside of the usual repitoire of most colleges. "How to Talk to Girls," "A Crash Course to Airplanes," "Adult Very Beginning Ballet," and many more classes are available for students in the greater Seattle area

### The Site
The site you see here is a total ground-up revamp. It features course pages, registrations, course applications, payment and much more. It is the beating heart of EXCO. It will soon replace the old and barely functioning live site.
